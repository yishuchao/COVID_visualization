# COVID_visualization
This is a new lab that Michelle Cheung and I designed for CS10. In this lab, we will walk students through how to visualize COVID-19 data with Python library Bokeh.

- `cs10-bokeh-lab.ipynb` is the reference notebook with all the blanks filled out

- `cs10-bokeh-lab-students-v2` is the one with blanks for students to fill out. 

- If you are using Datahub through your Berkeley account, make sure you upload ALL the files to your directory.
